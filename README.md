Diabetes Prediction Web Application

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques. The application utilizes a logistic regression model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to provide predictions based on user input.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions globally. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. This application helps in predicting diabetes risk by analyzing key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, and age.

# Features
- User-friendly web interface for data input.
- Predictive model based on logistic regression.
- Real-time predictions with clear output messages.
- Built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

# The following libraries are required to run this application:
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn


# The application uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains several health metrics:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)


# Usage Instructions
To use the application:
1. Fill out the patient information form with the required health metrics.
2. Click "Submit" to receive a prediction regarding diabetes risk.
3. The result will indicate whether the prediction is "Diabetic" or "Non-Diabetic".
